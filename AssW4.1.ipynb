    "Q2. Name the four pillars of OOPs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:-The four pillars of OOPS are:\n",
    "1.Abstraction:An abstraction is a form of simplification and organization, allowing developers to focus on the essential parts of their code without focusing on the implementation details. It helps developers create code in a more efficient manner, while still providing the same functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Encapsulation:Encapsulation is the process of combining data and codes into a single unit. It helps keep code organized, as well as helps prevent accidental data manipulation and changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Inheritance:Inheritance is the process of creating new classes based on an existing class. It allows the developer to create subclasses that will inherit the attributes and behaviors of the parent class. This makes it easy to reuse code, making development faster and more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Polymorphism:polymorphism is a form of abstraction that allows different classes to fulfill the same behavior. By taking advantage of polymorphism, developers can create code that is more easily maintained and more versatile."

    "A constructor also contains a collection of statements(i.e. instructions) that are executed at the time of Object creation. It is run as soon as an object of a class is instantiated. The method is useful to do any initialization you want to do with your object.\n"
